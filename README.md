# MboxImporter

A basic tool to import your `.mbox` file into MongoDB for query.

It's just a basic side-project development developed in a few hours for fun. Don't hesitate to provide pull-requests or to submit ideas.

On my machine (core i7, 8gb of ram), it imports approximately `2500 mails/second`.

## Build

```
go get github.com/bthomson/mbox
go get gopkg.in/mgo.v2
go build mboximporter.go

```
